# Formula 1 Data Analysis Project

### 📊 Exploring Formula 1 with Real-World Datasets (2013–2025)

Welcome! This project focuses on analyzing data from the **Formula 1 World Championship**, one of the most iconic and widely followed motorsport competitions in the world. It includes race results, qualifying stats, sprint races, and driver insights — all compiled to uncover trends and performance patterns over recent F1 seasons.

This is also part of my broader data science practice, where I apply techniques like data wrangling, visualization, and analysis using tools such as **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📁 Data Sources

The datasets used in this project were originally compiled by [toUpperCase78](https://github.com/toUpperCase78) and are based on information from:

- The official [Formula 1 website](https://www.formula1.com/)
- Driver ratings from Codemasters / EA Sports F1 video games ([link](https://www.ea.com/games/f1/driver-ratings?isLocalized=true))

## 🔮 Future Work

I'm actively updating data for the 2025 season as new races are completed. Older seasons may also be revisited to enhance visual quality and analysis depth.

This project also serves as a data science practice space where I’ll continue adding new projects, visualizations, and modeling exercises.got
